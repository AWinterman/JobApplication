I am applying for the Core Data Engineer position at Urban Airship on the
strength of my past experience and the recommendation of Dan S., a fellow
member of the Portland Python User's Group. I am excited by this opportunity to
employ predictive statistics and machine learning in the push notification
management context.

I have experience at a boutique web development company prototyping data
visualization methods, doing data analysis, and implementing machine learning
algorithms for social media data. I do the full process, from data retrieval to
processing to working prototypes of visualizations. I make scale models of the
finely polished product we push out the door. My data has, for the most part,
been small enough for my aging IMac to handle it, but I have run up instances
on Amazon's EC2 to run large computations, and written map-reduce jobs for the
Elastic MapReduce web service.

I am detail oriented, patient, and a quick study.  Although I do not currently
speak Java, I have a history of picking up new languages quickly, whether they
are natural or computer languages.  Sharp and calm, I am a goal-oriented, team
player, eager to contribute. I look forward to discussing my background and the
Core Data Engineer position at Urban Airship, either over the phone or in
person.

Thank you,
Andrew
