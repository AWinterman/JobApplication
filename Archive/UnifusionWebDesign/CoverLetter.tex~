\opening{Dear Mr.  Velansky} 
 
 I am applying for the Inside Sales Consultant position at the Portland offices of Unifusion. After investigating Unifusion's portfolio, I not only appreciate your product, but would be excited to market it.

I have experience programming in a behavioral genetics laboratory under the direction of professors Susan C. P. Renn and Albyn Jones. In my research with them, I solved applied problems having to do with interpretation of data using $R$, a language new to me at the time. I found the work satisfying, so much so that my last subject of study at the laboratory evolved naturally into my senior thesis. Since graduating, I have been pursuing  computer science and programming (in Haskell, Java and Scala) as a hobby | auditing courses and embarking upon personal projects. Although by no means an expert, I am comfortable talking about computer technology, and in fact eager to learn more about it.
 
 I am detail oriented, patient and because of my rigorous education,  accustomed to tackling multiple projects simultaneously. I have strong social skills, as evidenced by my four years as a member of the Reed College ultimate frisbee team and a recent volunteer position as an outdoor trip student leader. I am sharp and calm, a goal-oriented team player. These skills and characteristics make me a good choice for the  Inside Sales Consultant position. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss my background and the position with you, either over the phone or in person. I can be reached by phone at (714) 362 6823 or by email at andywinterman@gmail.com. 

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely, \\
Andrew Winterman

I am applying for a position at the Analysis Group.


I have experience using R (an environment for statistical computing relying on the language, S), LaTeX, Java and Haskell. My current projects include working through the problems presented by Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/) using lisp, learning Unix, html, and gaining a more technical understanding of the internet so as to make myself more marketable to employers in the field of computer science.
