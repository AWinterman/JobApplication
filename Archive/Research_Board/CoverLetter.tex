\opening{Dear Ian Storrar:} 
 
 I am applying for the research analyst position at the Research Board.
   
I have experience applying statistics in a behavioral genetics laboratory under the direction of professors Susan C. P. Renn and Albyn Jones. After a brief email conversation with Anna Rohleder, I believe my knowledge of statistics would allow me to more accurately interpret data gathered at the Research Board. My experience writing a senior thesis prepares me to write reports and do research in a professional setting. The research analyst position would allow me to further hone my writing skills and continue to bring sense to data. 
 
 I like detail oriented work, especially when it involves mathematics or computing. I am a patient researcher and a good communicator. I have strong social skills, as evidenced by my four years as a member of the Reed College ultimate frisbee team and a recent volunteer position as an outdoor trip student leader. I am sharp and calm, a goal-oriented team player. These skills and characteristics make me a good choice for a position at the Research Board. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss my background and the research analyst position with you.  I can be reached by phone at (714) 362 6823 or by email at andywinterman@gmail.com. 

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely, \\
Andrew Winterman

I am applying for a position at the Analysis Group.


I have experience using R (an environment for statistical computing relying on the language, S), LaTeX, Java and Haskell. My current projects include working through the problems presented by Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/) using lisp, learning Unix, html, and gaining a more technical understanding of the internet so as to make myself more marketable to employers in the field of computer science.
