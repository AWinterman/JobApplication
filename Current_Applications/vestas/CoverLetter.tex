I am interested in Vestas because I am excited about renewable
energy. I think becoming involved in the industry is not only
financially prudent, but also socially responsible. I see working for
Vestas as a way to make our world a better place. 

I have experience programming in a behavioral genetics laboratory at
Reed College under the direction of Professors Susan C. P.  and
Albyn Jones. In my research with them, I solved applied problems
having to do with the interpretation of data using $R$, a computer
language new to me at the time. I found the work satisfying, so much
so that my last subject of study at the laboratory evolved naturally
into my senior thesis in statistics. Since graduating in December, I
have been pursuing computer science and programming (using  the
computer languages Haskell and Scala), auditing courses at Reed and learning
about the \textsc{unix} operating system.
 
I am detail oriented, patient, and, because of my rigorous education,
accustomed to tackling multiple projects simultaneously. I have strong
social skills, as evidenced by my four years as a member of the Reed
College ultimate frisbee team and a recent volunteer position as an
outdoor trip student leader. Sharp and calm, I am a goal-oriented, team
player. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my
background and a position at Vestas  with you, either over the phone or in
person. I can be reached by phone at (714) 362 6823 or by email at
andywinterman@gmail.com.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely, \\
Andrew Winterman

I am applying for a position at the Analysis Group.


I have experience using R (an environment for statistical computing relying on the language, S), LaTeX, Java and Haskell. My current projects include working through the problems presented by Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/) using lisp, learning Unix, html, and gaining a more technical understanding of the internet so as to make myself more marketable to employers in the field of computer science.
