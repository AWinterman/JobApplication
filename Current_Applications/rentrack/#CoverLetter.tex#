\opening{Dear Miriam Leaz:} 


I am applying for the statistical research analyst position
at %NAME OF FIRM!!!
Rentrack. I am motivated to apply by my affinity for statistics. I
take great satisfaction in coaxing sense from data. Interpreting of data
provides  a meaningful contribution to the state of our knowledge| a
contribution which I, among few others, am equipped to provide.
 
I have experience programming in a behavioral genetics laboratory at
Reed College under the direction of professors Susan C. P. Renn and
Albyn Jones. In my research with them, I solved applied problems
having to do with the interpretation of data using $R$, a computer
language new to me at the time. I found the work satisfying, so much
so that my last subject of study at the laboratory evolved naturally
into my senior thesis in statistics. Since graduating in December, I
have been pursuing computer science and programming (using  the
computer languages Haskell and Scala)| auditing courses and learning
about the Unix operating system.
 
I am detail oriented, patient, and, because of my rigorous education,
accustomed to tackling multiple projects simultaneously. I have strong
social skills, as evidenced by my four years as a member of the Reed
College ultimate frisbee team and a recent volunteer position as an
outdoor trip student leader. I am sharp and calm: a goal-oriented, team
player. These skills and characteristics make me a good choice for the
statistical research analyst position at %FIRMS NAME
Rentrack. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss my
background and the position with you, either over the phone or in
person. I can be reached by phone at (714) 362 6823 or by email at
andywinterman@gmail.com.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely, \\
Andrew Winterman

I am applying for a position at the Analysis Group.


I have experience using R (an environment for statistical computing relying on the language, S), LaTeX, Java and Haskell. My current projects include working through the problems presented by Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/) using lisp, learning Unix, html, and gaining a more technical understanding of the internet so as to make myself more marketable to employers in the field of computer science.
